This Python script carries out Logistic Regression on the Iris dataset to identify various species of iris flowers based on measurements provided by the user. It utilizes the Iris dataset included in scikit-learn, which features data on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, and a logistic regression model is built using the training data. Once trained, the accuracy of the model is displayed based on its predictions on the test dataset. The program then asks the user to enter four numerical values that correspond to the flower's features and, based on this input, predicts and reveals the most likely species of iris.
