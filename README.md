1_logistic_regresssion.py
This Python script carries out Logistic Regression on the Iris dataset to identify various species of iris flowers based on measurements provided by the user. It utilizes the Iris dataset included in scikit-learn, which features data on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, and a logistic regression model is built using the training data. Once trained, the accuracy of the model is displayed based on its predictions on the test dataset. The program then asks the user to enter four numerical values that correspond to the flower's features and, based on this input, predicts and reveals the most likely species of iris.
2_decision_tree
This Python script employs a Decision Tree Classifier to forecast survival chances on the Titanic based on the information provided by the user. It starts by importing the Titanic dataset from the Seaborn library, cleaning it by eliminating rows that have missing values in essential columns such as age, fare, sex, embarked, and survived. Categorical variables like sex and embarked are then transformed into numerical values. The dataset is subsequently divided into training and testing sets. A decision tree model is fitted using the training data, and its performance is assessed on the testing data. In the end, the program asks the user to input details about a passenger (age, fare, sex encoded as 0 or 1, and embarked represented as 0, 1, or 2). It utilizes the trained model to predict whether this passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster and presents the outcome.
3_knn.py
This program uses a machine learning model called K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to recognize handwritten digits from small images.
It loads a dataset of digit images (like 0–9), where each image is 8×8 pixels (total 64 values).It trains the KNN model to learn what each digit looks like.It tests how accurate the model is using built-in test data.Then, it asks user to enter 64 numbers (the pixel values of a digit image).Finally, it uses the trained model to predict which digit user entered, based on the values.
